Current To-Do List:
- Intimidate bug
- Ripen makes Berry effects last 6 turns (later, not important rn)
- Stockpile should last for 3 turns when used the first time, 4 turns the second and 5 the third (who cares lol)



This is just a .txt to document how the PLA mechanics work coding-wise, in case I need a reminder or someone else
makes changes and needs a quick runthrough on how everything works. It's not *that* complicated, I just think
it's nice to have these things documented

Status Changes:

- Non-volatile statuses can be overwritten, and they are also removed after a set amount of turns

- All changes to statuses are made in conditions.ts. 

- Statuses overwriting each other is done by editing each individual status, adding the following code to each one:

	onAnyTryMove(this, source, target, move) {
				if (move.secondaries && move.id !== 'secretpower') {
					for (const secondary of move.secondaries) {
						if (secondary.status !== ('brn' || 'par' || 'tox' || 'psn' || 'frz')) return;
						this.add('-message', 'cleared Status');
						this.add('-curestatus', target, '*insert status*', '[Silent');
						target.setStatus('');
					}
				}	else if (move.status) {
						this.add('-message', 'cleared Status');
						this.add('-curestatus', target, '*insert status*', '[Silent]');
						target.setStatus('');
				}
			},
This isn't ideal of course, but it was the easiest way I could find since I couldn't figure out exactly what code
to edit at the time. In the future I'll possibly try and clean this all up, likely moving this all into scripts in
in the process, but until then everythings up there

- The duration for statuses is implemented similarly; with every individual status being edited:

	onStart() {
			this.effectData.startTime = 6;
			this.effectData.time = this.effectData.startTime;
		},
	onResidual(pokemon) {
			pokemon.statusData.time--;
			if (pokemon.statusData.time <= 0) {
				this.add('-curestatus', pokemon, 'brn');
				pokemon.setStatus('');
				return;
			}
		},
Again, this isn't ideal, but y'know. 


Boost Changes:

- Atk/SpA and Def/SpD are boosted simultaneously. Boosts are now cleared after a set amount of time, depending on
how many stats were boosted/if the stat boost was due to a secondary effect

- All boost changes are implemented in conditions.ts, under legendsboost. legendsboost itself is added to every
pokemon on switch-in thanks to legendsboostmod in rulesets.ts

- The code is a lil long so I won't copy/paste it here, but I essentially just stole Two-Minded's code (ty Hema x)
and made some minor changes. Checking if the boost came from legendsboost via if(effect.id === 'legendsboost') is 
crucial, since without it legendsboost would go into an endless feedback loop where it keeps activating its own
onBoost. Attempted to make it slightly less disgusting to look at via conditional operators,
but didn't work sadly

- atkBoost, defBoost, and speBoost are all used for the time calculation; if any of these variables are true, we
subtract 1 from the starting duration of the boost. That's basically it for now, I'll almost certainly come 
back and clean this code up, but until then it's pretty simple

- Quiver Dance is now an omniboost and I don't know how to feel about that


Jagged Splinters:

- I fucking hate runEffectiveness so much I swear nothing makes me feel so much pure rage than working with that
piece of shit method

- Atm it's pretty sloppy. It's just a block of if/else if statements. Not ideal by any means, but attempted to make
it less hard coded have so far been fruitless (again, fuck runEffectiveness). I have 0 idea if the damage
calculation works properly but whatever lol
